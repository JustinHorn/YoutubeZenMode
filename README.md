# Youtube Zen Mode chrome extension
Chrome Extension for youtube that keeps you out of the time wasting video loop by blocking suggestings and comments.
Because one of the best easiest ways to break a bad habit is by removing its triggers - out of sight out of mind.  

I often find myself drawn to youtube because of one or two good videos I have in mind.  
Yet I often stay for way longer than that, just to read the comments or watch another potentially interesting video from the recommondations.  
I also found it annoying that instead of focussing on the video and making up my own mind I have always been heavily influenced by the comments.  

To break these bad habits I made this chrome extension.
